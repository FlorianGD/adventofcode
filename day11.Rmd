## Part 1

We have to find the distance from the center in an hexagonal grid. We are given a path and we hve to find how close we land from the center. The path is given by directions : `n, nw, sw, s, se, ne`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)
```

I'm going to give coordinates to each direction, convert the input in a sum of coordinates, and find the distance to the center from the final coordinate.

```{r}
coord <- tribble(
  ~dir, ~vec,
  "n",  c(0, 1),
  "ne", c(0.5, 0.5),
  "se", c(0.5, -0.5),
  "s",  c(0, -1),
  "sw", c(-0.5, -0.5),
  "nw", c(-0.5, 0.5)
)
coord
```
